To host a website on Google Cloud with AMD instances, we follow these steps:

Firstly, we create a Google Cloud account and set up a project.

Secondly, go to the Compute Engine section in the Google Cloud Console.

Click on the "Create Instance" button to launch a new VM instance.

Under the "Machine type" section, we can select an AMD instance from the list of available machine types.

Then choose the preferred operating system and select a boot disk for the instance.

Configure the networking settings for the instance, including setting up a static IP address.

Now, open the firewall ports required for the web server to allow incoming traffic.

Install and configure the web server software on the instance, such as Apache or NGINX.

Upload the web application files to the instance, either through SSH or using a file transfer protocol (FTP) client.

Once the web app is uploaded, we can test it by navigating to the static IP address assigned to the instance in the web browser.

Finally! The website is now hosted on Google Cloud with an AMD instance.
