This webapp has been created using a popular Javascript library ReactJs.

React Features
 $ JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.

 $ Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

 $ Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.

 $ License − React is licensed under the Facebook Inc. Documentation is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

React Advantages
 $ Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.

 $ Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.

 $ Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.
